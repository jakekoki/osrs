# OSRS-CLI
An app that's lighter than something like OSBuddy (hopefully) and gives the functionality that I need on osrs.
- Grand Exchange price lookup 
- Price comparer
- Get tables from osrs wiki and display in shell

# TODO:
- Time series of GE price 
- Item compare matrices (just an n-item extension of price compare)
- Favorite GE item queries
- Gear stat compare 
- Integrate it into a discord bot that can output graphical and tabular data.
