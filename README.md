# OSRS-CLI
An app that's lighter than something like OSBuddy (hopefully) and gives the functionality that I need on osrs.
- Grand Exchange price lookup 
- Price comparer
- Get tables from osrs wiki and display in shell

# TODO:
- Time series 
- Item compare matrices (just an n-item extension of price compare)
- Favorites 
- Gear stat compare 
- Quest guides query 
-
